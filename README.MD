Built an app where a user can keep a record of their favorite artists. Used the MEHN stack to build the webpage using REST routes to load different pages. When starting I was trying to add a song field to the schema where it holds different songs of the artists. But for some reason when I tried to push a new song into the array, it would push 'null' even though when I console log the song it is a string. So I changed the field to album and everything works fine.

#Future
Would like to add an spotify API so the user can search their artists and add it to their database along with songs and albums. And have the ability to search for different users to find new artists/songs
